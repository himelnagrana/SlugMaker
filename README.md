# SlugMaker

## *******Disclaimer:******* *This repository is a collection and compilation --- rather than unique work of development.* 


I have compiled two great works which I got into touch with via google search. 

I have merged and modified (*to some minor extent*) the solutions to make use of it here. 

This solution is extremely helpful for generating "**slug**" or "**search engine friendly url**" with help of ***username*** (*or any text*) and ***id*** (*or any number*).
